**Palindra-palooza**

A python program that uses stack and checks if the linked text are palidrome.

**Introduction**

This python provides a stack functionality by performing push and pop operations and detemining if the connected string is palidrome.

**Features** 

-push data into the stack
-pop data from the stack at the provided index
-display the stack contents and check if the connected string is palindrome

**options**

-[1] Push Operation: push/add data to the stack
-[2] Pop Operation: pop data from the stack at the provided index
-[3] Display Stack and Check Palindrome: display the stack and check if it is palindrome
-[4] Exit: exit the program

**Discussion and Reflection**

I struggle a lot making this program becasue I make the palindrome and stack in different code file then connect it and that's when my code start to show a lot of bugs and i spent a lot of time to debug all of it. Eventually after all of that I achieved the output I wanted to see in this program. I realize that making pseudocode is very useful and make the code in same code file.
